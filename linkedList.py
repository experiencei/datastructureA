# Reverse Linked List

# Question --> Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

# Example 1
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

# Solution --> we want to swing the current with previous value and previous with current value 

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev, curr = None, head

        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
