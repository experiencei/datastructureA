# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

# Question --> You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
# You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
# Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


# Example 1:

# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
# Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        
        lowest = prices[0]
        for price in prices:
            if price < lowest:
                lowest = price
            res = max(res, price - lowest)
        return res



# Contains Duplicate II
# Question --> Given an integer array nums and an integer k, 
#             return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.


# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
# Output: true

class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> bool:
        window = set()
        L = 0

        for R in range(len(nums)):
            if R - L > k:
                window.remove(nums[L])
                L += 1
            if nums[R] in window:
                return True
            window.add(nums[R])
        return False
